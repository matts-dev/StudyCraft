# StudyCraft
A program I quickly made in the summer of 2016 - it parses notes and provides many ways to quiz yourself based on those notes.
It has fully supported gui for managing classes, and has a special randomization algorithm that maintains a certain study context,
but also provides randomization within that context. The algorithm is recursive and treats each topic with subtopics as a
module and randomizes the components within the module. I will probably make a short video demoing exactly what this means since 
it would require a paper to properly explain.
